/* 
async await
async await make proimses easier to write and work with.

Notes:
- async functions return a Promise
- await makes a function wait for a Promise. (can only be used inside async functions)
- if you're not creating the Promise in the function, you'll want to wrap it in a try catch block for error handling.
- Since async functions return a Promise, you can use .then and .catch on them.
