SASS - Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets
SASS makes it much easier to write CSS.

How does it work?
- Sass gets compiled into CSS.

Features:
- Indentation to represent hierarchical structure. (Star Feature ‚≠ê)
- Better variables
- Other stuff

How to get started?
- Simply create a .scss file and start writing.
- Install Live Sass Compiler extension is VSCode.
- To compile into css, simply click the "Watch Sass" button at the bottom of your toolbar.

Other:
- There exists a .sass filetyle. Dont use this. It rids the use of curly braces and relies on indentation,
What this means though is that you cannot write plain css in this, you can only ever write sass.
.scss is much more favoured. You can write regular css and take advantage of SASS whenever you want.
