After you init your node project (npm init)..

1. Install Tailwind to the project (usually as a dev dependency). 
npm install -D tailwindcss

2. Init Tailwind.
npx tailwindcss init

Add the path to your html files in the content array.
Configure your tailwind.config.js file to your liking as needed (usually nothing else needed).

3. Create your main css file and add the tailwind imports. 
This is where you can also write your custom css.

``` style.css ```
/* Tailwind CSS */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Custom CSS */
``` ``` ```

4. Open a new terminal tab and start the tailwind watcher/compiler.
npx tailwindcss -i ./path/to/style.css -o ./path/to/tailwind.css --watch
(You can also add this command as a script in your package.json file as I've done in this project).

This will create a tailwind.css file with all the tailwind classes.

5. Link the compiled tailwind.css file to your html file.

6. Start working!
Write tailwind in the html files, and add custom css in the style.css file.
