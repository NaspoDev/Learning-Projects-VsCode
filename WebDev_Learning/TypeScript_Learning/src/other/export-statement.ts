export {};
// Sometimes you'll see the export statement at the top of a file.
// It is a way to export the contents of a file so that it can be imported into another file, making it a module.

// Sometimes though you'll need to use it because of a variable name declaration glitch,
// where the variables name hasn't been declared before, but it's throwing an error because of some internal typescript thing.
