What is TypeScript?
- TypeScript is a direct superset of Javascript. All JS it valid TS.
- TypeScript offers type declaration (static typing) to Javascript, making things less error prone.
- Much better IDE tooling, linting, intellisense, etc.
- Basically always use it over JS for larger projects.

Installation
- TypeScript needs to be installed as an npm package.
- `npm install typescript -D`
- Typically installed as a devDependency.

TypeScript Compiler
- TS doesn't work natively in any browsers. It needs to be compiled to JS first to run.
- Compile one file `tsc <file.ts>` command, compile all at once with `tsc`.
- Setup compile configurations in the tsconfig.json. (See that file for more info).

TS-Node
- Should you want to run typescript scripts directly, maybe for testing, you can use ts-node module.
- `ts-node <file.ts>` to run a file directly. (ts-node must be installed globally)
- ts-node technically compiles the file and runs it in memory, so it's not as fast as running a compiled JS file.

tsconfig.json
- Where you can configure the behaviour of your typescript, compilation, and other things.
